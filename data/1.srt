00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
hello and welcome it's Chris here and

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:07,200
I'm so excited and humbled to be here

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:10,170
with you 11 years ago I was exactly

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,630
where you are now starting to learn iOS

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,070
programming and how to build apps don't

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,170
worry it's not going to take you

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,060
anywhere close to that amount of time to

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,670
get skilled at this because you have

9
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,830
these videos showing you exactly what to

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,590
learn and what order to learn them in

11
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,630
and plus you have me here to help you

12
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,730
clear any roadblocks that are in your

13
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,800
way in this course you're going to learn

14
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,809
the foundational skills needed to build

15
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,520
any sort of app you're going to learn

16
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:37,530
how to use Xcode to build user

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,180
interfaces you're going to learn and

18
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,160
practice the ins and outs of writing

19
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,780
Swift code so that when it comes time to

20
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,420
write your own app you won't even bat an

21
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,640
eye these are the two foundational

22
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,129
skills that every great iOS developer

23
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,010
has mastered after you get a solid

24
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:54,930
foundation with Swift and Xcode which

25
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,879
you most definitely will after going

26
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,520
through this course then you can explore

27
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,800
the other features of iOS now with that

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,870
said let me give you three tips on how

29
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,990
to go through this course effectively

30
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:09,090
number one temporarily put aside your

31
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,830
dream app I'm going to take you through

32
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,869
building four different apps in this

33
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,640
course and even though they might not

34
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:16,920
seem like they have anything to do with

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,630
what you want to build I assure you the

36
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,790
skills that you're going to acquire from

37
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:24,000
building these four apps they're going

38
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,670
to be crucial to build anything number

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,490
two this goes without saying but build

40
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,860
each lesson on your own computer this

41
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,020
hands-on work will be the heavy lifting

42
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,750
that will accelerate and transform your

43
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,990
knowledge into actual real-world skills

44
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,780
and number three expect frustration

45
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,520
learning anything new is hard but that's

46
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,799
why you're here this course has gone

47
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,780
through numerous iterations and updates

48
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,149
and revisions in the last five years and

49
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,950
this one is the best version yet that's

50
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,439
why I believe you're in the unique

51
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,439
position to succeed so with that said

52
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,810
welcome again I'm so excited to be here

53
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,140
with you and I can't wait to see what

54
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,140
you build
